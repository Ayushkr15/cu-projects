    "description": "This project report from Chandigarh University analyzes how fintech solutions drive financial inclusion, particularly for underserved populations. It highlights that innovations like mobile banking (e.g., Kenya’s M-Pesa), digital payments, and peer-to-peer lending have enabled 1.2 billion adults globally to access financial accounts (2010–2017), yet 31% remain unbanked. Case studies, such as India’s India Stack, demonstrate fintech’s ability to reduce costs, enhance efficiency, and reach remote communities. However, challenges like regulatory barriers, cybersecurity risks, and the digital divide persist. The report recommends balanced regulatory frameworks, collaborations between fintech firms and traditional institutions, and investments in digital infrastructure and financial literacy. It concludes that coordinated efforts among governments, regulators, and industry stakeholders are essential to fully harness fintech’s potential for equitable financial inclusion.",

    "description": "This project report from Chandigarh University analyzes how Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) mitigates conflicts in manufacturing, focusing on Vardhman Textiles. Key findings reveal CSR initiatives in education, healthcare, rural development, and environmental protection (e.g., water conservation, skill programs) reduced labor disputes (55% of employees strongly agreed) and enhanced community trust. However, only 20% of customers linked Vardhman to CSR, indicating visibility gaps. Employee surveys (100 respondents) highlighted effective grievance management but noted lingering supply chain disputes (18%). Recommendations include boosting CSR transparency via social media, fostering NGO partnerships, and aligning initiatives with local needs to strengthen conflict prevention and sustainable impact.",
